Strategy used : TD(lambda)
Reasons:
* The other common strategies we know of, for reading State reward pair 
given fo a fixed strategy are
		* Monte-carlo learning which is TD(1)
		* TD(0) which is TD(Lamda) at lambda to 0.

Algorithm decription:
After parsing the datafile to read in all the values,
we intialise V with 0 and e as 0.
Now for the episod described in each step,
we calculate the expected total reward value using current reward and using current V estimate.
We change the e(eligibility) of episode adding one.
Finally we update V keeping alpha as the learning rate.
Also eligibility is multiplied by gamma and lambda as a control parameter of how back you are looking. 

ALpha Decay:
alph = alph_0 * (1.0/(1+(step_num//100)))

Parameter Estimation:
For the given 2 samples, the goal was to keep the error low and find a parameter that gets good result in both.
